BANKING ACTIVITY SIMULATION PLATFORM

The Bank Simulator is a full-stack web application built using React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot (Java) for the backend. It simulates real-world banking operations, allowing users to create accounts, log in, deposit, withdraw, transfer funds, check balance, view transaction history, and update or delete accounts. Transactions can also be downloaded as Excel files for record-keeping. The app uses RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend, and localStorage for session management. With an interactive UI and modular routing via React Router, it provides a simple yet powerful digital banking experience.
